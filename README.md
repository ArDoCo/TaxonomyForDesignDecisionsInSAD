# A Taxonomy for Design Decisions in Software Architecture Documentation
This is the supplementary material repository of the paper "A Taxonomy for Design Decisions in Software Architecture Documentation".
In this paper, we propose a taxonomy for design decisions in software architecture
documentation with the purpose to support activities, such as specific test case creation, trace link recovery, or the identification of inconsistencies between different artifacts.
Additionally, we developed a new dataset comprising 17 software architecture documentations from publicly available open-source projects. We classified the contained design decisions based on the taxonomy.
Further, we explored if state-of-the-art machine learning-based classifier are able to automatically identify the design decisions and their subcategories in the dataset.

This repository contains the dataset and code used in the paper, as well as information on the annotation process:

* [dataset](./dataset/) contains the extracted software architecture documentations (`.txt` files) and the per-line labels (`.csv` files) 
* [annotation](./annotation/) contains information about our labeling:
	* [texts](./annotation/texts): the extracted software architecture documentations
	* [annotator1](./annotation/annotator1): the results of the labeling of the main annotator for all 17 documentations
	* [annotator2](./annotation/annotator2): the results of the first annotator involved in the labeling of the three projects used for manual validation
	* [annotator3](./annotation/annotator3): the results of the second annotator involved in the labeling of the three projects used for manual validation
	* [IAAgreement](./annotation/IAAgreement/): inter-annotator agreement (Krippendorf's Î±, KALPHA)
* [implementation](./implementation/) contains the python modules and notebooks used to produce the results of the automated classification
* [results](./results/) contains the results of the automated classification

|-----------------------------------------|
|Note that we are not able to provide the actual models that were used to produce the results of the paper. We used 5-fold cross validation experiments with three repeats that would result in a huge amount of model files. As the model files are quite large, this is not feasible. The results may still be reproduced with the supplied notebooks.|

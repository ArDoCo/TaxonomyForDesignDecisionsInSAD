The system should be constructed in a modular fashion via plugin mechanism in order to be easily modified in the future.
There are two subsystem, the engine that runs in the background and web interface.  

Engine Workflow
Each project in the BIBINT is composed of three stages : 
 - collection, handles the gathering of information from multiple sources (i.e. digital library, homepage)
   A project has a collection of documents. 
   Each document should have a detailed meta data. 
   In order to get these metadata, a site handling is required. 
   Site handling is not only required to access the data from the website but also to handle interaction with the site (i.e. searching for papers, authors, etc). 
   Currently there are three forms of a data item that can be fed: raw html, Bibtex files, raw PDF. 

 - analysis, applying analysis algorithm to the gathered data
   this subsystem contains various algorithm that can be applied

 - presentation, integrating various analysis as a single coherent information
   most of the algorithm can not be produce output immediately so for efficient presentation, these result should be stored temporarily for later retrieval and display.

Communication between the stages is to be stored in a pool handle that is shared among stages. 
The pool handle can be used with storage subsystem that handles abstraction of interacting with underlying storage mechanism. 
this subsystem should give consistent interface regardless of the implemented storage (filesystem, relational, RDF store, cloud storage, etc.)

Web Interface Workflow for early version, the system is assumed to be operated by single user so no access control is required. 
However, there should be a management that can handle multiple project. 
Each project supposed to have separate repository. 
The web interface is supposed to bridge interaction with the engine. 
For simplicity, the interface should be done via command line.
